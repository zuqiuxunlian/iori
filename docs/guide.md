## Introduction

The IORI timer is a simple and easy to use that can quickly assist coaches in completing test evaluations of team members and can also be a powerful tool to individual training.

### Why do it

I personally run a non-profit football camp for adults that we train once a week. I also work as a part-time weekend coach for some youth clubs. There is always the problem of how to evaluate the players in the long-term training.

> Evaluation tests, which involve practical exercises designed specifically to obtain the most precise and objective data possible from the basic game components forming part of the teaching content. This type of evaluation is also known as the quantitative method.  
> -- UEFA Fusal Coaching Manual

Evaluation is an essential part of training, so do we have tools to use?

#### Why Not...?

#### Stopwatch

Stopwatches, including mobile phones and sports watches, have timing functions. But there are two disadvantages. You need someone to help you set the watch. Second, there are certain errors in the beginning and end of the hand pinch. We can replace the function of a stopwatch that can be completely replaced, and the time is visible and easy to video record.

#### Infrared/laser timer

To judge the beginning and end by a non-contact way is indeed the most accurate way at present, and does not affect sports performance at all. However, its price is also very expensive, the equipment is not convenient to carry, and the operation threshold of the equipment is relatively high. Our operation is much simpler, even the children can fully master.

### IORI timer advantage

  Just power it on and you're ready to go—no setup hassle.

## How it works?

### Laser trigger not need relector

The timer utilizes eye-safe infrared laser, eliminating the need for reflector. By default, it operates over a trigger distance of 1.3 meters, easily covering the width of a standard track. For different sports need, the trigger distance can be adjusted to 2.3, 4.3, or 6.3 meters, offering flexibility for a variety of environments.

### Wireless connect long way

The IORI timer uses a long-range wireless protocol to connect over distances greater than 200 meters with stable and reliable control. It supports simultaneous connection of up to **11 devices**, making it ideal for creating a 100m split timing system. This ensures accurate timing across different points on the track, providing flexibility and precision for various sporting events.

## How to use?

IORI Timer supports almost all sprint and agility test. Let me show you.

### Track and Field

<!-- 通常地，需要一个朋友帮你发令，按住 SET，释放的同时发令 GO，这将包含反应时间。终点使用激光触发结束。 -->

Normally, you’ll need a friend to help you with the start.
Hold down **READY** for set, and release it while calling **GO** — this will include your reaction time.
The finish is triggered by the laser sensor.

#### Flying test

<!-- 以前，当使用秒表时，行进间测试非常难获得准确数据。如今，你只需放置计时器在你需要的位置，就可以获得任何区间的时间。
我们支持激光触发启动，同时终点也是激光触发结束。 -->

In the past, it was difficult to get accurate data for flying sprints when using a stopwatch.
Now, you can place the timers wherever you need and get precise times for any segment.
We support laser-triggered starts, and the finish is also activated by a laser sensor.

<!-- #### Split timing system -->

<!-- 很多教练想在一次训练测试中获得 60 米和 100 米的成绩，只需要增加额外的计时器。每多增加一个计时器，就可以多测试一个分段。 -->

<!-- Many coaches want to get both 60m and 10 m results in a single training test.
You only need to add extra timers — each additional timer allows you to record one more split. -->

<!--  -->

<!--  -->

<!-- #### Multi-Lane Test -->

### 40 Yard Dash

<!-- 按照 NFL Combine 的要求，40 码测试在运动员启动后才开始计时。因此运动员自己手按计时器准备，3 点式启动，这将不包含启动反应时间，非常接近 NFL 的正式测试。终点仍然是激光触发结束。 -->

According to NFL Combine standards, the 40-yard dash timing starts only after the athlete begins to move.
Therefore, the athlete can manually press the timer to get ready and start from a 3-point stance — this setup excludes reaction time and closely replicates the official NFL test.
The finish is still triggered by the laser sensor.

<!-- ## Classic Test

The IORI timer performs all tests with consistent start and end points. Such as shuttle run, T-test and so on. When we design our training program, we try to have the same start and end point. In addition, the IORI timer can be used to test time challenges, such as the maximum time to juggle continuously and the time to plank.

Of course, we can also just take it as a mobile phone remote controller, with mobile phone and mobile phone tripod, can be very convenient for training video recording.

### T-test

The T-test includes accelerate, decelerate, shuffle, and backward, which are the basic movements required in football. Standard movement, and shorter completion time, the stronger the athletic ability.

### 60 ball juggling challenge

The time it takes to complete 60 ball juggle. Drop the ball can be picked up to continue, the number continues to accumulate until the number of 60. -->
