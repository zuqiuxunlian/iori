## Introduction

The IORI timer is a simple and easy to use that can quickly assist coaches in completing test evaluations of team members and can also be a powerful tool to individual training.

### Why do it

I personally run a non-profit football camp for adults that we train once a week. I also work as a part-time weekend coach for some youth clubs. There is always the problem of how to evaluate the players in the long-term training.

> Evaluation tests, which involve practical exercises designed specifically to obtain the most precise and objective data possible from the basic game components forming part of the teaching content. This type of evaluation is also known as the quantitative method.  
> -- UEFA Fusal Coaching Manual

Evaluation is an essential part of training, so do we have tools to use?

#### Why Not...?

#### Stopwatch

Stopwatches, including mobile phones and sports watches, have timing functions. But there are two disadvantages. You need someone to help you set the watch. Second, there are certain errors in the beginning and end of the hand pinch. We can replace the function of a stopwatch that can be completely replaced, and the time is visible and easy to video record.

#### Infrared/laser timer

To judge the beginning and end by a non-contact way is indeed the most accurate way at present, and does not affect sports performance at all. However, its price is also very expensive, the equipment is not convenient to carry, and the operation threshold of the equipment is relatively high. Our operation is much simpler, even the children can fully master.

## How it works?

### Laser trigger not need relector

The timer utilizes eye-safe infrared laser, eliminating the need for reflector. By default, it operates over a trigger distance of 1.3 meters, easily covering the width of a standard track. For different sports need, the trigger distance can be adjusted to 2.3, 4.3, or 6.3 meters, offering flexibility for a variety of environments.

### Wireless connect long way

The IORI timer uses a long-range wireless protocol to connect over distances greater than 200 meters with stable and reliable control. It supports simultaneous connection of up to **11 devices**, making it ideal for creating a 100m split timing system. This ensures accurate timing across different points on the track, providing flexibility and precision for various sporting events.

<!-- ## Classic Test

The IORI timer performs all tests with consistent start and end points. Such as shuttle run, T-test and so on. When we design our training program, we try to have the same start and end point. In addition, the IORI timer can be used to test time challenges, such as the maximum time to juggle continuously and the time to plank.

Of course, we can also just take it as a mobile phone remote controller, with mobile phone and mobile phone tripod, can be very convenient for training video recording.

### T-test

The T-test includes accelerate, decelerate, shuffle, and backward, which are the basic movements required in football. Standard movement, and shorter completion time, the stronger the athletic ability.

### 60 ball juggling challenge

The time it takes to complete 60 ball juggle. Drop the ball can be picked up to continue, the number continues to accumulate until the number of 60. -->
